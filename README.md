# AgathaChristie 
This data set was created for the article "The Little Grey Cells" (Significance, October 2020).
It contains covariate information for characters included in a large sample of Agatha Christie's detective stories.
Some of the covariates are at the individual level, for example, gender, occupation and whether of not they are the killer; others are the book level, for example, the number of victims and the murder weapon used.
